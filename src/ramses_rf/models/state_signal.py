"""Communication quality read-model (domain layer, per device).

Computes per-device communication quality from transport-layer RSSI
data.  The domain layer queries the HGI-side ``RssiTracker`` to
determine ``best_rssi`` — the strongest recent signal across all
HGIs that have heard the device.

This is a **read model**, not stored state: it is computed on demand
from the transport-layer RSSI trackers.  The domain entity holds a
reference to the tracker(s) and computes quality lazily.

Staleness (time since last transmission) is also tracked here, as it
is a domain concern — the device entity knows when it was last heard.

See: https://github.com/ramses-rf/ramses_cc/issues/1047
