"""RAMSES RF - Passive device scan engine.

A read-only observer that listens to RF traffic, classifies unknown devices
by prefix and verb/code pairs, and maintains an in-memory discovery list.

This module is the scan engine only — it does NOT:
  - create devices in the registry (no `get_device()` calls)
  - mutate topology (no `TopologyChangedEvent`s)
  - write to disk (everything in-memory, consumer calls `export_json()`)
  - depend on Home Assistant (plain Python, works in CLI)

The consumer (ramses_cc or the CLI) is responsible for persistence,
notifications, and user-facing accept/discard workflow.
