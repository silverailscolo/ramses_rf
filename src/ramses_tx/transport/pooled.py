"""RAMSES RF - Pooled transport for multi-HGI link-layer pooling.

Combines multiple physical transports (serial, MQTT, ser2net) into a
single coherent :class:`TransportInterface` that the protocol layer
sees as one transport.  Inbound packets from any child are
deduplicated within a sliding time window and forwarded upstream.
Outbound frames are routed to the child transport with the best
rolling-average RSSI, falling back to stable-first selection (first
sendable child in config order) when no RSSI data is available yet.
Unhealthy children are detected via a configurable health timeout.
Online children are preferred; connected stale children are retried only
as a last resort and recover after a successful transmission or RX.

This is Roadmap Item 9, PR 1 (issue 1119).

PR 1 rework: replaces parallel mutable arrays with an encapsulated
:class:`PoolChild` record per route, adds ingress provenance
(``ingress_hgi_id`` separate from RAMSES ``addr1``), loopback
exclusion from route RSSI, a dict-backed O(1) dedup cache with
sequence-aware keys, and RSSI TTL expiry.  Runtime
``add_child()``/``remove_child()``/``set_accepted_hgis()`` are
removed — construction and config-entry reload build immutable child
registries for the first release.
