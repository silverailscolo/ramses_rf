## Overview

**ramses_rf** is a client library/CLI utility used to interface with some Honeywell-compatible HVAC & CH/DHW systems that use 868MHz RF, such as:
 - (Heat) **evohome**, **Sundial**, **Hometronic**, **Chronotherm**
 - (HVAC) **Itho**, **Orcon**, **Nuaire**, **Vasco**, **ClimaRad**

It requires a USB-to-RF device, either a Honeywell HGI80 (somewhat rare, expensive) or something running the [evofw3](https://github.com/ghoti57/evofw3) firmware, such as the one from [here](https://indalo-tech.onlineweb.shop/) or your own ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 N16R8 with a CC1100 transponder.

It does three things:
 - decodes RAMSES II-compatible packets and converts them into useful JSON
 - builds a picture (schema, config & state) of evohome-compatible CH/DHW systems - either passively (by eavesdropping), or actively (probing)
 - allows you to send commands to CH/DHW and HVAC systems, or monitor for state changes
 - allows you to emulate some hardware devices

For CH/DHW, the simplest way to know if it will work with your system is to identify the box connected to your boiler/HVAC appliance as one of:
 - **R8810A**: OpenTherm Bridge
 - **BDR91A**: Wireless Relay (also BDR91T)
 - **HC60NG**: Wireless Relay (older hardware)

Other systems may well work, such as some Itho Daalderop HVAC systems, use this protocol, YMMV.

It includes a CLI and can be used as a standalone tool, but also is used as a client library by:
 - [ramses_cc](https://github.com/zxdavb/ramses_cc), a Home Assistant integration
 - [evohome-Listener](https://github.com/smar000/evohome-Listener), an MQTT gateway

## Installation

To use the `ramses_rf` Integration in Home Assistant, just install `Ramses RF` from HACS. It will take care of installating this library. See the [`Ramses_cc wiki`](https://github.com/zxdavb/ramses_cc/wiki/1.-Installation) for details.

To run the `ramses_rf` client or study the code:
```
git clone https://github.com/zxdavb/ramses_rf
cd ramses_rf
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For development, see our [Developer's Resource](README-developers.md)

## Ramses_rf CLI

The CLI is called ``client.py`` and is included in the code root.

For example, to monitor ramses_rf messages picked up by a dongle connected to port USB0, and log them in `packet.log`:
```
python client.py monitor /dev/ttyUSB0 -o packet.log
```
To view the `client.py` help:
```
python client.py --help
```

To send a command to a device, type:
```
python client.py execute /dev/ttyUSB0 -x "_verb [seqn] addr0 [addr1 [addr2]] code payload"
```
Notes:
- Before the `I` verb, add a whitespace inside the opening double quote: [RP]|[RQ]|[ I]
- Skip empty device addresses;
- Don't enter the packet length.

Send command example:
```
python3 client.py execute /dev/cu.usbmodemFD131 -x " I 29:091138 32:022222 22F1 000406"
```
See the [client.py Configuration wiki page](https://github.com/zxdavb/ramses_rf/wiki/client.py-configuration-file) for more.
