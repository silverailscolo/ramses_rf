# Ramses_rf developer's resource

## Installation

Confirm you have Python 3.13.x installed by running:
```
python3 --version
```

### Virtual environment

Create a `venv` virtual environment, for example on macOS or Linux:
```
mkdir /your-path-to/virtual-envs
mkdir /your-path-to/virtual-envs/ramses_rf
cd /your-path-to/virtual-envs/ramses_rf
Python3.13 -m venv ~/your-path-to/virtual-envs/ramses_rf
```
where `Python3.13` is the python version to set for the `venv`.

Repeat for every session:
```
cd /your-path-to/ramses_rf
source ~/your-path-to/virtual-envs/ramses_rf/bin/activate
```
and confirm your Terminal prompt looks like:
`(ramses_rf) user:ramses_rf `
